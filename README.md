It is a Counter-Strike 1.6 plugin, with the /plist command it will display the number of players that have been connected to the server in 24h
All players are stored in the Mysql database.
After 30 days, players will be deleted from the database, and the counter will start over
I will leave some pictures for you to see in more detail :D
